# MyWebsite1

.NET 8 MVC · HTML5 · CSS · jQuery · AJAX

MyWebsite1 is a small **personal gallery / downloads project** built with **ASP.NET Core 8.0 MVC**.

The goal of the project is to explore:
- ASP.NET Core MVC fundamentals
- ASP.NET Identity integration
- File uploads and downloads
- Basic UI interactions with jQuery and AJAX
- Light / Dark theme switching

---

## About Running the Project

When the project is downloaded or cloned, it may not start immediately.

This is expected.

The application uses:
- Entity Framework Core
- ASP.NET Identity
- A local development database

Because of this, the database is not included in the repository and must be generated locally.

---

## About the Data

The database schema is created using Entity Framework Core migrations.

If an existing database is present from a previous run or from another environment, it may not match the current project state.

In such cases, starting with a clean database ensures correct behavior.

---

## Scope of the Project

This is a **small-scale project** intended for:
- learning
- experimentation
- portfolio demonstration

Some features are intentionally kept simple and minimal.

---

## Technologies Used

- .NET 8.0
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Entity Framework Core
- ASP.NET Identity
- Bootstrap
- jQuery

---

This project is not meant to be production-ready, but rather a clean and understandable example of an ASP.NET Core MVC application.
